<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Through my passion for creation I engaged with varius activities, like writing, creating websites and web content. 
 One thing led to another and while studying Theology,in Kapodistrian University of Athens, I took the decision of following the developers career and expand my knowledge on the field so, as a perfectionist, I could have better outcome in what I do. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, I worked in many jobs, such as cashier, sales, babysitter and merchandiser and I gained many skills I'm thankful for.!</p>

<p>Now I'm more mature, learned to be more responsible and reliable person and appreciated the importance of team work and respect among team members and co-workers!</p>
